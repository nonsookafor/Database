This is a design for a form that takes the first and last name of its user. When the user clicks on the submit button, the user is redirected to another page where the user is also asked for his/her first name and last name. A database is created to store the first and last names of the user otgether with the time the user clicked the submit button after inputting these names. Also found on this redirected page is a table gotten from the database containing the first and last names of every user in the database together with the date/time they clicked the submuit button after inputting their names.
